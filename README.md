## cBoy - A [Nintendo GameBoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) Emulator written in C++

cBoy is a work in-progress [Nintendo GameBoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) Emulator. Its aim is to offer high compatibility and good performance. 

This project is a "next step" project for me, after writing several [Chip8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) Emulators.
